# Convert and Upload Kali Generic Cloud Image to DigitalOcean

This GitHub Action automates the process of downloading, converting (compressing), and uploading the **Kali Linux Generic Cloud Image** to **Custom Images in DigitalOcean**.

## Features

- Downloads a specified version of the Kali Linux Generic Cloud Image (currently hardcoded to Kali Linux 2024.3).
- Converts and compresses the image for compatability with DigitalOcean.
- Uploads the compressed image to DigitalOcean's Custom Images using the DigitalOcean API.
- Versioning is maintained and incremented automatically for each upload.

## Usage

### Fork the Repository

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top of the GitHub repository page.
2. Once forked you can use it directly from your account.

### Secrets Setup

You'll need to create the following secrets in your forked repository for the action to work:

1. **`DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`**: Your DigitalOcean API token. You can generate it in your DigitalOcean API settings.
    1. Create A New Personal Access Token and give the token a name.
    2. Choose **Custom Scopes** then the only scope needed is **Image > Create**.
2. **`REGION`**: The DigitalOcean region where you'd like the image to be uploaded (e.g., `nyc3`, `sfo3`, etc.). The valid region slugs are listed in the DigitalOcean API documentation.

To add these secrets:

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret** and add `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `REGION`.

### Workflow Permissions

Once you fork the repository, you'll need to update your **workflow permissions** to allow the action to commit and push changes to `version.txt`:

1. Go to **Settings > Actions > General** in your forked repository.
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select **"Read and write permissions"**.
3. Check the box for **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**.

### Running the Workflow

Once your secrets and workflow permissions are set, you can manually trigger the workflow:

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your repository.
2. Select **Convert and Upload Kali Generic Cloud Image to DigitalOcean** from the left-hand sidebar.
3. Click **Run workflow** under the **workflow_dispatch** section.

### Updating the Kali Linux Image Version

By default, the workflow is set to download and convert the **Kali Linux 2024.3 Generic Cloud Image for x64**. If a new version of the image is released, youâ€™ll need to manually update the image URL in the workflow file.

To do so:

1. Check for the latest image version at [Kali Linux Cloud Images](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-cloud).
2. Update the download URL in the workflow:
    ```yml
        - name: Download Kali Image
          run: wget https://kali.download/cloud-images/<new-version>/<new-image-file>.tar.xz
    ```

4. Commit and push the changes to your fork.

## Notes

- **Versioning**: The workflow automatically increments the version of the image (`v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0`, etc.) and commits the updated version to `version.txt`. This ensures that each uploaded image has a unique version number.
- **Custom Images**: This workflow uploads the Kali Linux image to DigitalOcean's **Custom Images** service. You can use this custom image to create droplets in DigitalOcean.
- **Workflow Impact**: Running this workflow will increment the version in `version.txt`, so it's important to either fork the repository or maintain your own version tracking.
